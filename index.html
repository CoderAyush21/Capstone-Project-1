    <h3>Summary</h3> 
    <hr/>
    <p>
        Having recently completed my Cambridge A-level examinations in November 2024, I anticipate starting my tertiary education in 2025 with a focus on engineering, particularly in the domains of software development and autonomous systems. During my time at Royal College Curepipe (RCC), I consistently devoted myself to my studies, which is evident in my academic performance records. I thrive on intellectual challenges and am eager to expand my knowledge and skills in coding and programming. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have actively participated in various extracurricular activities and competitions, which have further honed my teamwork, time management, and problem-solving abilities. I believe these attributes are essential for a successful university experience. Furthermore, my passion for sports has played a significant role in my personal development. As an avid football player, I have participated in numerous football tournaments at RCC, primarily taking on the role of goalkeeper. In addition to sports, music holds a special place in my heart. I have nurtured a love for singing since childhood, and ever since I started learning to play the guitar, my appreciation for the art has deepened even further.
