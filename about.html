<h1>About Myself</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Having recently completed my Cambridge A-level examinations in November 2024 at the age of nineteen, I anticipate starting my tertiary education in 2025, focusing on engineering, particularly in software development and autonomous systems. I am keen on studying software engineering since I have always been passionate about creating new and innovative tools, whether on the computer or in real life. Thus, there is no better chance for me than to study software development. During my time at Royal College Curepipe (RCC), I have constantly devoted myself to my studies, which is evident in my academic performance records. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have actively participated in various extracurricular activities and competitions, which have further honed my teamwork, time management, and problem-solving abilities. Furthermore, my passion for sports has played a significant role in my personal development. As an avid football player, I have participated in numerous football tournaments at RCC, primarily taking on the role of goalkeeper. In addition to sports, music holds a special place in my heart. I have nurtured a love for singing since childhood, and ever since I started learning to play the guitar, my appreciation for the art has deepened even further.</p>
